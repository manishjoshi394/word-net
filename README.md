# WordNet
This repository consists of a set of classes that provide an effective API that allows the clients to do a set of queries related to lexical relationships between words in English(Or any other language, if you have the required database).

**See the API documentation here. [https://manishjoshi394.github.io/word-net/](https://manishjoshi394.github.io/word-net/).**

####  Prerequisites
- If you don't know what is WordNet, read this Wiki page. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordNet
- If you don't know about Directed-Graphs, refer here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph
- If you don't know what is Lowest common ancestor(LCA) & Shortest Ancestral Path(SAP), give it a quick skim https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor
- If you don't have the Educational [algs4](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar) library, [download it](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar) and add it to your 'CLASSPATH' (or extract the classes as required at compilation). I'll be using algs4 for doing simple graph processing. 

**NOTE: Though the code can very well be used to faciliate other Natural Language processing applications, the Code is NOT what it potentially can be. There is a big space for improvement to the code and repo is open for changes. For instance, this implementation does not use the [Gloss]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloss_(annotation))**
 
### So, What's cool about it?
- **One class in the repo can do this -** 
With a suitable client, the API allows you to give two words in command line, you get what's the nearest parent noun they belong to.
For instance, 'java WordNet apple banana' can be made to output 'fruit' by use of API. Of course the client code needs to deal with the UI/UX, if you want a GUI, you can!, the classes give the core functionality where you just pass the two given words as arguments to a function and you get the result as string. The client decides what to do with this string.
- **Another class in the repo can do this -**
Here too, with a suitable interface, the APi allows you to identify an most odd noun in given set of nouns. For example, you provide words'assassin', 'killer', 'monkey' as an Iterable to a function in the API, you get 'monkey' as an Outcast i.e; An ODD among others. Ofcourse ambiguities arise. But the API can be used for Natural language processing applications so that machine understands semantics of human's languages.
All nouns are compared mathematically for relatedness, so the algorithm is strictly mathematical. A whole Network of Lexical 
relationships is built using a rooted Directed acyclic graph as a data structure.

### Quick Description of Classes :
#### NOTE: This is just a quick summary. See this GitHub page for full API documentation. [https://manishjoshi394.github.io/word-net/](https://manishjoshi394.github.io/word-net/)
#### 1. SAP.java
This class calulates Shortest ancestral path in a directed-graph the path is returned as an Iterables of vertices(represented as integers). You can read more in the file itself or compile a JavaDoc using the same source.
#### 2. WordNet.java
The WordNet uses SAP to give nearest common lexical ancestor of given two words. It uses necessary Symbol Table implementations to achieve the same. The class provides a function to check 
#### 3. Outcast.java
The class identifies most odd word out of given set of words. (The old school exam question!)

### Resources required for the preprocessing of WordNet.java
The location of the files [synsets.txt](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/wordnet/synsets.txt) and [hypernyms.txt](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/wordnet/hypernyms.txt) needs to provided to the WordNet.java constructor as two strings for all sorts of processing, these files contain the required language data; you can download them to you local system.
You can add more words and lexical relationships to the end of these said files by observing the CSV structure of these files and then adding any data to them taking special care to NOT disobey the existing structure of the files.
